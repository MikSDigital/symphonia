Soulex Project
==============

This project is devoted to building new solution in Content Management Systems
based on Zend Framework. It started as a great will to learn more about
popular framework. Later administration panel was added. Interface was
based on joomla's project. I hope anyone who wants to learn more about
Zend Framework will find something usefull in this project. 
As for me I continue adding some new features in hope that the project
someday will expand its possibilities in becoming system for large amounts
of people to make building their sites as easy as possible.
I hope you enjoy working with it!
